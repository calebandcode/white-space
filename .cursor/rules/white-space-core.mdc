You are helping me build “White Space” — a local-first desktop app for gentle digital decluttering.

PRINCIPLES

- Local-first, no uploads, no tracking.
- Archive-first safety (delete only after a 7-day cooling-off).
- Calm, progressive disclosure (summary → buckets → details).
- 3-stage gauge: Potential → Staged → Freed (single segmented arc).
- Rolling 7-day window for metrics (optional weekly reset day).
- Strong safety rails: skip dev repos, path keywords, recent sibling activity, user deny/allow lists.

STACK

- Tauri 2 (Rust core) + React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- Tailwind + shadcn/ui + framer-motion
- Zustand + React Query
- SQLite (rusqlite, WAL) with refinery migrations
- Lemon Squeezy Licensing (client License API: activate/validate/deactivate)

GENERAL RULES

- Prefer smallest, safest path; clear errors; one-click Undo.
- Tauri 2 security via Capabilities (no v1 allowlist).
- Long operations: progress reporting + cancel/rollback.
- Tests first where risky; strict types; no Node-only libs at runtime.

When implementing, create files with full paths, add imports, and include minimal tests.
